## Entity Evolution and Development Overview

The simulation includes several entity types—archetypes (via `OctNode`), titans (`TitanForger`), specters (`SpecterEcho`), and civilizations (`Civilization`)—each with evolution or development mechanisms. These are managed by dedicated classes (`ArchetypeEvolver`, `CivilizationEvolver`, and `EmotionEvolver`) and integrated into the main loop, responding to quantum states, anomalies, and social dynamics. This section details their functionalities and AGI relevance.
