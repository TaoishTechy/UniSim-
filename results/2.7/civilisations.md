## Civilization Functionality Overview

The civilization system in this script simulates autonomous entities (`Civilization` class) with cultural attributes, technological progression, and sigil synergy, influenced by node stability and governance. These entities evolve through the `CivilizationEvolver` class, reflecting adaptive behaviors in response to environmental and social conditions.

### 1. `Civilization` Class
- **Description**: Represents a civilization with unique cultural and technological traits, residing on a specific page (node) in the hypergrid.
- **Attributes**:
  - `id`: Unique identifier.
  - `page_idx`: Index of the associated page.
  - `culture`: One of ["Technocratic", "Mystic", "Nomadic", "Harmonic"].
  - `tech_level`: Technological advancement (0.1 to 1.0).
  - `sigil_affinity`: A sigil string reflecting cultural symbolic preference.
  - `population`: Number of inhabitants (1000 to 100,000).
  - `resources`: Resource availability (0.1 to 1.0).
- **Methods**:
  - `advance(node)`: Advances the civilization based on its culture and node stability:
    - **Technocratic**: Increases `tech_level` and `population` with `stabilityPct`.
    - **Mystic**: Boosts `tech_level` and `population` with `resonance`.
    - **Nomadic**: Grows with lower `social_cohesion` (thrives on change).
    - **Harmonic**: Enhances with higher `social_cohesion`.
  - `adopt_sigil(sigil)`: Adopts a new sigil if similarity to `sigil_affinity` exceeds 0.6, boosting `tech_level` with a 20% chance of updating `sigil_affinity`.
- **Purpose**: Models cultural evolution and technological progress tied to environmental conditions.
- **AGI Relevance**: Simulates adaptive learning and cultural transmission, key for AGI's ability to evolve behaviors in diverse contexts.

### 2. `Governance` Class
- **Description**: Manages regulatory systems for each page, influencing node dynamics and sigil usage.
- **Attributes**:
  - `page_idx`: Associated page index.
  - `regime`: One of ["Monarchy", "Council", "Anarchy", "Technocracy"].
  - `authority`: Governance strength (0.3 to 0.7).
  - `policies`: Dictionary with `sigil_control`, `qubit_regulation`, and `resource_allocation` (0.0 to 1.0).
- **Methods**:
  - `enforce_policies(node)`: Modifies node properties based on regime:
    - **Monarchy**: Decohers qubits and boosts `social_cohesion`.
    - **Council**: Increases `stabilityPct` and `coherence_time`.
    - **Anarchy**: Reduces `social_cohesion` and decohers qubits.
    - **Technocracy**: Enhances `stabilityPct` and `resonance`.
  - `restrict_sigil(sigil)`: Applies transformations (e.g., rotate, substitute) based on `sigil_control` and `authority`.
- **Purpose**: Introduces governance as a stabilizing or destabilizing force, affecting quantum and social states.
- **AGI Relevance**: Reflects regulatory frameworks in AGI, where control mechanisms could optimize or constrain system behavior.

### 3. `CivilizationEvolver` Class
- **Description**: Manages civilization evolution based on `tech_level` and node stability.
- **Attributes**:
  - `evolutions`: Dictionary mapping cultures to advanced/degraded states:
    - **Technocratic**: "QuantumHive" / "MachineCult".
    - **Mystic**: "CosmicConclave" / "LostSect".
    - **Nomadic**: "Starfarers" / "WanderingTribes".
    - **Harmonic**: "ResonanceCollective" / "DiscordantFragment".
- **Methods**:
  - `evolve(civ, node)`: Triggers evolution with a 1% chance:
    - **Advanced**: If `tech_level > 0.8` and `stabilityPct > 0.7`.
    - **Degraded**: If `tech_level < 0.3` and `stabilityPct < 0.3`.
    - Logs events in `civilization_evolution_events`.
- **Purpose**: Simulates cultural adaptation to environmental pressures.
- **AGI Relevance**: Models evolutionary learning, where AGI could adapt its strategies based on performance and context.

### 4. Civilization Integration in Main Loop
- **Description**: Civilizations advance and interact within `update_node_dynamics` and the main loop:
  - **Advancement**: Called per page in the loop, updating `tech_level` and `population`.
  - **Sigil Adoption**: Triggered by `craft_sigil`, influencing `shared_sigil_ledger`.
  - **Governance Interaction**: `enforce_policies` applies during node updates.
- **Implementation**: Iterates over `civilizations` and `governances` lists, synchronized with node states.
- **Purpose**: Ensures civilizations evolve dynamically with the simulation's quantum and social landscape.
- **AGI Relevance**: Demonstrates real-time adaptation and interaction, akin to AGI's need for continuous learning and social simulation.

### 5. MemoryLedger Integration
- **Description**: Persists civilization states in `memory_ledger.data["civilizations"]`.
- **Implementation**: Saves `id`, `page_idx`, `culture`, `tech_level`, `sigil_affinity`, `population`, and `resources` on exit, loading them on startup.
- **Purpose**: Maintains civilization continuity across sessions.
- **AGI Relevance**: Supports long-term memory and state retention, critical for AGI's persistent learning.

### 6. Interaction with Other Systems
- **Quantum States**: `tech_level` and `population` growth are influenced by node `stabilityPct`, `resonance`, and `social_cohesion`, tied to `Qubit352` dynamics.
- **Anomalies**: Civilizations may adopt sigils post-anomaly fixes, affecting stability.
- **Governance**: Policies modulate civilization advancement and sigil use.
- **Archetype Evolution**: Shared page conditions influence both civilization and archetype evolution.
- **Purpose**: Creates a feedback loop between quantum, social, and cultural layers.
- **AGI Relevance**: Mirrors multi-modal integration in AGI, where social, technical, and environmental data inform decisions.

## Emergent Behavior
- **Cultural Diversity**: Different cultures respond uniquely to node conditions, leading to varied evolutionary paths.
- **Technological Convergence**: High stability or resonance can drive advanced states (e.g., "QuantumHive"), while instability leads to degradation.
- **Sigil Synergy**: Adoption of sigils fosters technological boosts, reflecting cultural adaptation to symbolic tools.
- **Cross-Page Influence**: Civilizations on connected pages may share stability or tech advances, simulating cultural exchange.
